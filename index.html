		<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>I used to be a student at Hertford Regional College studying TV and Film but I've taken a recent interest in code. Well, it's not that recent, in GSCE's I got an A in IT web development and I that's where the interest originally spiked, even if we were forced to use an old version Dreamweaver. </p>
			<p>Since the end of my college course I've been self learning from TeamTreeHouse.com, I started on HTML and CSS since that's what I was familiar and I've only dabbled in Python and Javascript for a few hours each. </p>
			<p>A goal in python for myself was to attempt to create a turn based text adventure that has multiple endings but I'm quite far off of that.</p>
			<p>University isn't my thing and I was thinking about an apprenticeship but an intense course seem more efficient considering that majority of them seem to help with getting a job afterwards so that's what I'm aiming towards in education.</p>

		<h2>My Coding Experience So Far</h2>
			<p>Secondary school was the first instance of me using HTML, I took IT for a GCSE and got an A but I wasn't sure if web development was the path I wanted to go down so I didn't explore it throughout college although I did go into developers tools occasionally to peek at the code. I actively started studying around mid-November, got a Team TreeHouse account and started with HTML to refamiliarize myself with the basics along with learning more about CSS. After that I started python, attempting to make part of a text based adventure game. Currently I've only made a sequence (which is on GitHub and is very basic) and I would like to complete it but I thought that I should first cover more ground and learn Javascript for the time being and then try some PHP just so I've got some knowledge in back-end of web development.</p>
			<p>I've tried to incorperate some Javascript into this site and looked up how to do something along the lines of turn based combat with random stats but I couldn't figure that out in time so there's just a dice roll in the Javascript container. </p>

			<p>I've had quite a few issues with making websites recently. I own a 1440p monitor and have only been making repsosive css for mobiles and tablets so it completely slipped my mind that I had to make a 1080p layout so as I made one and tested it out it the mobile layout got ruined and clashes with the 1080p rules. I tried to find a solution but the problem seems to be with the way I want to display them. I used grid items because they were easy(easier) to manipulate but I don't think that I'm experienced enough to use them well. But hey, hopefully this course will help me comprehend more advanced... well everything.</p>
